Users after logging in can ask questions in portal or answer to
the questions asked by anyone in the portal

I used MongoDB to store the questions and answers and other

Answers are displayed in order of Likes obtained

CRUD operations are implemented in such a way that users
posted the question/Answer only will rights to modify/delete
their posts.
